        <p class="text">Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts.
            Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river
            named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country,
            in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about
            the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of
            Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there
            were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen.
            She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the
            first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove,
            the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question
            ran over her cheek, then she continued her way.</p>
        <p class="text">On her way she met a copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten
            a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text
            should turn around and return to its own, safe country. But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it
            didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged
            her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten,
            then they are still using her. Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia,

            the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that
            was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its

            Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there

        <p class="text2" style="padding-top:15px;">One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible
            vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
            domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to
            slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly
            as he looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although
            a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread
            out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut
            out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat
            and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
            Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>
        <p class="text2">Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit
            longer and forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used
            to sleeping on his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However hard he threw himself
            onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so
            that he wouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull pain
            there that he had never felt before.</p>
        <p class="text2">"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business
            like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top of that there's the curse of
            travelling, worries about making train connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all
            the time so that you can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!" He felt
            a slight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so that he could lift
            his head better; found where the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots which
            he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back
            because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder. He slid back into his former position.</p>
        <p class="text2">"Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've got to get enough sleep. Other travelling
            salesmen live a life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning to copy
            out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their breakfasts.</p>
        <p class="text2">I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be the best
            thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have
            gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him everything I would, let him know just what I feel.</p>
        <p class="text2">He'd fall right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up there at your desk, talking down
            at your subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go right up close because the boss is hard of
            hearing. Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to pay off my parents' debt to him -
            another five or six years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll make the big change. </p>

        <p class="text" style="padding-top:15px;">A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with
            my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
            souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence,
            that I neglect my talents.</p>
        <p class="text">I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
            artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the
            upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary,
            I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
            unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar
            with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who
            formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around
            us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem
            to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing,
            Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within
            me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend -- but
            it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity
            has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.</p>
